# Antithesis Go SDK

This library provides methods for Go programs to configure the [Antithesis](https://antithesis.com) platform. Functionality is grouped into the packages [`assert`](https://antithesis.com/docs/generated/sdk/golang/assert/) for defining new test properties, [`random`](https://antithesis.com/docs/generated/sdk/golang/random/) for Antithesis input, and [`lifecycle`](https://antithesis.com/docs/generated/sdk/golang/lifecycle/) for controlling the Antithesis simulation.

For general usage guidance see the [Antithesis Go SDK Documentation](https://antithesis.com/docs/using_antithesis/sdk/go/)
